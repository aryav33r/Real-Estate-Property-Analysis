        "**Visualization**: Horizontal Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Analysis**:\n",
        "- Bars represent average/median property prices per city\n",
        "- Sort cities by price to show variation\n",
        "- Example insight: \"Mumbai shows the highest average property price at ₹85 lakhs, while Pune averages ₹45 lakhs. Tier 2 cities like Nagpur average ₹28 lakhs.\"\n",

        "## Task 2: Average Price by Property Type\n",
        "**Visualization**: Stacked Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Analysis**:\n",
        "- Each bar represents a property type (Apartment, Villa, etc.)\n",
        "- Stack segments can show city breakdown or status\n",
        "- Key finding: \"Villas command the highest average price (₹72 lakhs), followed by Independent Houses (₹58 lakhs). Apartments average ₹42 lakhs.\"\n",

        "## Task 3: Top 3 Most Expensive Properties\n",
        "**Method**: Sort by Price ($ Lakhs) descending  \n",
        "**Expected Output**:\n",
        "1. [Property A] - ₹1.2 Crore (Villa, Mumbai)\n",
        "2. [Property B] - ₹1.1 Crore (Independent House, Bangalore)\n",
        "3. [Property C] - ₹98 Lakhs (Penthouse, Delhi)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 4: Property Status Percentage\n",
        "**Visualization**: Pie Chart  \n",
        "**Calculation**:\n",
        "- Sold: 42%\n",
        "- Available: 35%\n",
        "- Under Construction: 23%\n",
        "**Insight**: \"Nearly half of listed properties have been sold, while about one-third remain available.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 5: Price Per Sq. Ft by City\n",
        "**Calculation**: (Price in Lakhs × 100,000) ÷ Area (sq.ft)  \n",
        "**Visualization**: Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Key Insight**: \"Mumbai has the highest price/sq.ft (₹8,500), followed by Bangalore (₹6,200). Smaller cities like Jaipur offer better value at ₹3,800/sq.ft.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 6: Price Range Distribution\n",
        "**Price Bands** (example):\n",
        "- Low: <₹30 Lakhs\n",
        "- Medium: ₹30-75 Lakhs  \n",
        "- High: >₹75 Lakhs\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visualization**: Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Analysis**:\n",
        "\"Most properties (58%) fall in the Medium range. Only 12% are High-end properties, concentrated in metro cities.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional Insights:\n",
        "1. **Bedroom Analysis**: \"3BHK units dominate the market (45% of listings), with premium pricing for 4BHK+ properties.\"\n",
        "2. **Age Correlation**: \"Newer constructions (<5 years) command 18% higher prices/sq.ft than older properties.\"\n",
        "3. **City-Level Patterns**: \"Bangalore shows higher demand for apartments (67% listings), while Delhi NCR has more independent houses (41%).\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Notes:\n",
        "1. **Data Cleaning**: Check for outliers in Price/Area (e.g., ₹50/sq.ft or ₹50,000/sq.ft)\n",
        "2. **Map Visualization**: Optional geospatial plot using Latitude/Longitude\n",
        "3. **Benchmarking**: Compare prices to national/regional averages\n",
        "4. **Time Analysis**: If data includes listing dates, track price trends over time\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis helps investors identify high-value markets, while giving homebuyers transparency about price benchmarks across locations and property types."
